# 100DaysOfSwiftUI By Paul Hudson
Learning swiftUI will be helpful for my career as an iOS developer. I would like to take this course from Pual Hudson for 100 days to be good at SwiftUI.

## Days 1-14: Introduction to Swift
The first 14 days provide a gentle warm up for your SwiftUI learning as we cover the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. You’ll work through a selection of tutorials every day, and there is some optional extra reading afterwards if you’d like to dig deeper.

Regardless of whether or not you go over the optional extra reading, you’ll find lots of short short tests – I recommend you take them to really solidify what you’ve learned.
