import Foundation

struct ExpenseItem : Identifiable, Codable {
    // let id = UUID() // However, you will see a warning that id will not be decoded because we made it a constant and assigned a default value. This is actually the behavior we want, but Swift is trying to be helpful because itâ€™s possible you did plan to decode this value from JSON. To make the warning go away, make the property variable like this:
    var id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let type: String
    let amount: Double
}
