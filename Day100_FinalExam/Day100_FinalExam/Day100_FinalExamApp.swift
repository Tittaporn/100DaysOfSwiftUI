/* Final exam --> https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/100
 Today is the final day of the 100 Days of SwiftUI, which means you made it. You went through all 100 days of learning, watching videos, taking tests, completing challenges, and writing code, and you made it to the end.

 Even though we’ve probably never met, I feel proud of you. Nothing about this challenge was easy: I made you work study every day, I pushed you to answer well over a thousand questions about Swift and iOS, and I gave you difficult challenges to complete.

 I have no doubt that some of the work was difficult for you – you might have sometimes repeated a day, you might have skipped a few challenges here and there, and it’s possible you even thought about giving up more than once.

 But you didn’t give up – you made it. As Aisha Tyler said, “success is not the absence of failure; it's the persistence through failure.” And that’s what you’ve shown: even when things weren’t going to plan with your code you stuck with it – you persevered – and you got through all 19 projects and more as a result.

 Today you have one last test: the final exam for the 100 Days of SwiftUI. This one is different from the others in four important ways:

 1) You’ll be tested across all parts of the curriculum, from the first project to the last.
 2) The questions almost entirely one ones you’ve seen before, although perhaps not for a few months in some cases.
 3) You get a certificate when you pass the test. You should download this, and share it with others – you earned it!
 Now, I said there were four differences and only listed three above. That’s because the fourth difference might scare you a little, so here goes: there are 100 questions.

 Yes, 100.

 There’s no reading to do today; no videos to watch. This exam is the only thing you need to complete. This exam is the only thing between you and graduating from this challenge.

 So, set aside an hour of your time, get a drink next to your computer, and put yourself in the right in the right state of mind. Most importantly: take your time. There’s no point rushing through this.

 Out of the 100 questions, you’ll need to get at least 70 correct in order to pass the test. If you score at least 80 percent you’ll pass with merit, and you score at least 95 percent – getting just five questions wrong out of 100 – you’ll pass with distinction.

 Good luck.

/* What now?
 Congratulations on completing the 100 Days of SwiftUI! I expect you’re feeling a number of different things right now.

 I’d like to think that you’re proud of all the work you put in. Doing 100 days of coding might have sounded easy in the first week or so, but by week eight you probably had to work harder and harder to motivate yourself.

 I expect you feel tired, both physically but also mentally. Honestly, I wouldn’t blame you if you wanted a week or two away from Swift. Trust me: you’ve earned it!

 I hope you feel inspired for the future. This course was designed to expose you to a range of SwiftUI features in a hands-on way, so you’ve learned about all the major features of SwiftUI alongside Core Image, MapKit, and more. You won’t build an app that uses all those things, but everyone will take different things from the course and use those experiences to build their own dream app.

 However, one thing you’re almost certainly feeling is a weird sense of emptiness. For the last 100 days you’ve been taking an hour or more out of your day to work on Swift – you’ve spent so long listening to my voice ramble on about @State properties and similar, but now that’s all finished, so there’s a “100 Days of SwiftUI”-shaped hole in your life.

 The natural question your brain asks is “what now?”

 Well, I have a few suggestions.

 *** Support free learning  ***
 First, if this course was useful to you I’d like you to consider either subscribing to my tutorials or buying one of my books. I’ve provided everything here – all the daily introductions, all the videos, all the tests, and more – free of charge, because I want to help folks reach their goals regardless of their income.

 But if you enjoyed this course and want to fund my continued free work, you should consider subscribing to Hacking with Swift+ – a tutorial service that delivers high-quality videos and articles to help you do your best with Swift.

 Hacking with Swift+ even includes my massive Ultimate Portfolio App course, which walks you through building one SwiftUI app that has great architecture, testing, accessibility and more, while also using Core Data, CloudKit, Apple Pay, notifications, haptics, and more. Heck, I even show you how to port the app to macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, all so you can show off your new skills to potential employers.

 Alternatively, you could buy a book from me:

 - Pro Swift teaches you advanced Swift skills.
 - Swift Design Patterns teaches you advanced iOS app architecture.
 - Testing Swift teaches you how to write tests to make your code more stable.
 - Swift Coding Challenges gives you a range of coding problems to help you pass job interviews.
 
 *** Ship an app  ***
 It’s one thing to code an app but quite another to ship an app. You need to spend far more time finding and fixing bugs, testing on various devices, and of course taking screenshots, writing descriptions, and more.

 So, for all the apps you’ve built so far – including all the challenges that you wrote yourself – you’ve done the first 90% of the work, but if you want real experience it’s time to do the second 90% of the work and actually ship the app.

 *** And finally…  ***
 Throughout these 100 days I’ve tried to inspire you, make you think, and perhaps even make you laugh with a range of quotes from people in our industry and beyond.

 Today I’d like to sign off with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson: “What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.”

 I’ve always said that programming is an art, and that you shouldn’t spend all your time sharpening your pencil when you should be drawing. Well, now it’s time for the sharpening to stop and the drawing to begin – I hope you enjoy it, I hope you reach your goals, and I hope you find great success with SwiftUI!
