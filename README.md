## Days 1-14: Introduction to Swift
The first 14 days provide a gentle warm up for your SwiftUI learning as we cover the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. You’ll work through a selection of tutorials every day, and there is some optional extra reading afterwards if you’d like to dig deeper.

Regardless of whether or not you go over the optional extra reading, you’ll find lots of short short tests – I recommend you take them to really solidify what you’ve learned.

NEW: Day 1 – variables, constants, strings, and numbers
NEW: Day 2 – Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1
NEW: Day 3 – Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
NEW: Day 4 – type annotations and checkpoint 2
NEW: Day 5 – if, switch, and the ternary operator

NEW: Day 7 – functions, parameters, and return values
NEW: Day 8 – default values, throwing functions, and checkpoint 4
