                /*
                Typical reasons for an error here include:
                * The parent directory does not exist, cannot be created, or disallows writing.
                * The persistent store is not accessible, due to permissions or data protection when the device is locked.
                * The device is out of space.
                * The store could not be migrated to the current model version.
                Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.

        container.viewContext.mergePolicy = NSMergePolicy.mergeByPropertyObjectTrump // Make sure you run that code, because it works really well – all our candy bars are automatically sorted into sections when the Add button is tapped. Even better, because we did all the heavy lifting inside our NSManagedObject subclasses, the resulting SwiftUI code is actually remarkably straightforward – it has no idea that an NSSet is behind the scenes, and is much easier to understand as a result. Tip: If you don’t see your candy bars sorted into sections after pressing Add, make sure you haven’t removed the mergePolicy change from the DataController class. As a reminder, it should set to NSMergePolicy.mergeByPropertyObjectTrump.
